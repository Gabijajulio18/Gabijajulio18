## 🧠 About Me

Graduated in **Sports Science** with a postgraduate degree in **High Performance Training**, I began my professional career in the field of sports (**Swimming Coach**).

At the same time, I have been actively building a second path in an area that has always fascinated me: **technology**. I discovered a strong interest in programming. This curiosity led me to independently explore key areas of **Data Science** and **Artificial Intelligence**, including Python, Statistics and Probability, Data Manipulation and Analysis, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Visualization, and Data Ethics and Privacy.
